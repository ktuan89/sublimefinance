View stock/coin price within sublime

Create an empty document within Sublime Text, open the Command Palette by Command+Shift+P and search for "Stock: watch from the current view" or "Coin: watch from the current view" to turn your view into a stock or coin watcher.

In order to make the Coin watcher work, open Coin.sublime-settings file and modify api_key. You can get an api_key for free at https://www.worldcoinindex.com/apiservice
